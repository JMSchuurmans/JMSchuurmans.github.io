I'm jarred awake by the sound of my iPhone ringing underneath my pillow. The brightness of the screen hits my eyes and I try to focus on it. It's my alarm. 4:00 am. Time to get up.

I hit the snooze and slide it back under my pillow, knowing that I won't sleep anymore. I tell myself that it's time. I tell myself I can do it. It doesn't matter that I went to sleep only four hours before. It's time.

I stumble to the living room where I've laid out my running clothes the night before. I put them on and down a bottle of water. I have enough time for a run and a shower before logging in to Learn at 5:00. I put my earbuds in and walk out the door. As I start running, Eminem blasts through my headphones, asking

> Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
>
> To seize everything you ever wanted
> 
> One moment
> 
> Would you capture it or just let it slip?

I think about how I will feel, after all this work, facing my first technical interview for my first job.

> His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy ...

I feel angry as I pick up the pace, tightening the drawstring of my hoodie to brace myself against the chill of this Oregon morning. I think about where I've come from and what brought me here, learning to code. I think about how I fell in love with it when I first printed "Hello World!" onto my computer screen. And I think about how it's harder than I thought it would be. But I also remind myself that this is it. I love programming, even though I know I'm just getting started, and this is my one shot to have the life I want, not for me, but for my family.

I met my wife in college eight years ago. We were in love, so we got married. Back then, I had maybe a hundred dollars to my name. After she graduated, I decided to transfer to a school in Boston. Neither of us had ever been there, but we went with nothing except for what we could fit in the suitcases we took on the plane. For the first week, we slept on our bedroom floor, using a pile of clothes as a mattress. We acquired some furniture and slowly pieced together our apartment, and before long it felt like home.

Fast forward two years later, and my career in academia was at an end. Not sure what else to do, we decided to move back home, and I went to culinary school. I spent the next four years working in kitchens all around Portland, but I knew I didn't have a future as a chef. I was never the most talented cook on the line, and the other chefs always had something I didn't. Food was their obsession -- it was their life. But it wasn't mine. Obsession is what makes you work fourteen hour days for twelve bucks an hour. I was never home, and we were always living paycheck to paycheck. At a certain point, I realized I needed to do something that would help me give my family the life they deserved. And if it turned out that I loved it, all the better.

All this comes back to me, as Eminem raps

> All the pain inside amplified by the fact
> 
> That I can't get by with my nine to five
> 
> And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
> 
> 'Cause man ... foodstamps don't buy diapers

I found coding accidentally. I literally just saw an ad for a bootcamp on Facebook and thought to myself, "that's something I haven't thought of yet." I started researching software development and bootcamps until I found Flatiron School and the Bootcamp Prep Course. I eagerly started it, and found myself fascinated by HTML. By the time I started opening up the developer tools in my browser and playing around with different websites, I was in love. I found that code made sense to me. Even if I couldn't fully understand the logic behind a given method, my instincts were generally right, and my code would work. When it didn't work (which was a lot of the time, actually), I loved tweaking it until it wasn't broken anymore. I don't know where my coding journey will take me, but I know that I can't do anything else. This is it for me, not only because I love it, but because this is the one shot I have to give my family a better life. Some opportunities only come once. This is my shot, and I'm taking it.

No doubt about it, learning to code is hard. If anybody else out there reads this and struggles sometimes to get up in the early hours, or push through that lab that has you totally stumped, just remember
