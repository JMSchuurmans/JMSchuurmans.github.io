<p>I'm a programmer-in-training at Flatiron School. I live and breathe code. I love writing clean, simple code, and writing about code. I love building things that make people happy. I love talking about Ruby, CSS animations, object orientation, and programming in general. If you find yourself in Portland, Oregon, shoot me an email. We can grab a beer.</p>
