<p>I'm a programmer-in-training at Flatiron School. I live and breathe code. I love writing clean, simple code, and writing about code. I love building things that make people happy. I value hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play. I love talking about Ruby, programming in general, teaching kids how to code, dad jokes, books, music, movies, wine, and really whatever. If you find yourself in Portland, Oregon, shoot me an email. We can grab a beer.</p>
